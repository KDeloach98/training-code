## What is a RPA?

RPA (Robotic Process Automation)

    -(RPA) is a software technology that enables the creation, deployment, and management of software robots that mimic human activities while dealing with digital systems and software.

    - RPA can not only help you save money on human capital as you expand, but it can also help you avoid the repercussions of human mistake. Aside from the money RPA may save you, it can also free up a lot of time for your existing staff, allowing them to focus on value-added activities like company growth.

## Lifecycle of RPA 

The RPA lifecycle is the framework for delivering and executing automation. It includes all of the stages a bot goes through, from defining a business process or job to automate through its deployment as a bot in production and subsequent continuous monitoring.

RPA lifecycle management refers to how each stage of a bot's life is managed to ensure that it provides the intended value to the company. It provides a process automation framework to guarantee that the bot is developed to meet its needs. It also provides a segmented approach to guarantee that each stage of RPA delivery can be evaluated and enhanced in order to increase execution and performance.
